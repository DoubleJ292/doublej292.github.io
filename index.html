				  <h7>Capstone Project Description</h7>
				  <p>SuperiorWes, a small business that specializes in audio software and basic IT assistance, has contracted me to create a NAS Server with multiple features including a network-wide adblocker, monitoring tool, remote access, and an Emby server for video presentations. The project also includes the installation and setup of OpenMediaVault, 1 root account, and 3 guest accounts with restricted access on Emby, and the installation of SSH client on PCs and laptops. The project requires the installation of a lite version of Debian for the NAS OS, the fortification of the server, and VLAN of the NAS on the managed switch. The estimated completion time for this project is 48 hours, and the necessary infrastructure for this project requires heavy hardware and a managed switch for VLANs. The project is divided into 8 weeks, with each week dedicated to specific tasks, such as the setup and build of the NAS, installation of Emby and OpenMediaVault, installation of an adblocker and monitoring tool, disabling unnecessary services, and setting up remote access. The project will conclude with the testing of the functions and the completion of documentation and a final report. With my education and research, I am confident that I will be able to complete this project successfully and satisfy the client's needs.</p><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjzjoBGJTmiVd3NBEK__Dt5JPVE?e=tCZnUP" target="_blank" style="color: white; display: block; text-align: center; font-size: 26px;"	> Click Here to see the Capstone Project Draft File</a><br><br><br><br>
